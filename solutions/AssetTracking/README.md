## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Power Platform Environment**
   - Power Apps license (per-user or per-app)
   - Dataverse database enabled
   - System Administrator or System Customizer role

2. **PowerShell Modules** (for scripted deployment)
   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
   Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell -AllowClobber
   ```

### Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended for first-time)

1. Go to [https://make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com)
2. Select your environment
3. Go to **Solutions** > **New solution**
4. Create solution named `AssetTracking`
5. Follow table definitions in `tables/*.json` to create tables
6. Create Model-Driven App using `app_definition.json` as guide
7. Import flows from `flows/` (if applicable)
8. Configure security roles from `security/roles.json`

#### Option 2: Scripted Deployment

```powershell
cd "[installation_path]\generated_solutions\AssetTracking_20251027_144515"
.\deployment.ps1
```

Follow the prompts to deploy to your environment.

### Post-Deployment Configuration

After deploying the solution:

1. **Assign Security Roles**
   - Go to Settings > Security > Users
   - Assign appropriate roles to users

2. **Update Connection References** (if flows are included)
   - Go to Solutions > Your Solution > Connection References
   - Update to use production connections

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Set any environment-specific values

4. **Test the App**
   - Open the Model-Driven App
   - Test all functionality
   - Verify security roles work correctly

## Solution Architecture

### Data Model


**Tracked Item Table** (`cr_trackeditem`)
- Tracks physical items with location and status
- Includes: Name, Barcode, Location, Status, Assigned To, Category
- Mobile-optimized for barcode scanning

**Location Table** (`cr_location`)
- Reference table for physical locations
- Includes: Location Name, Building, Floor, Room, Capacity


### User Interface

The Model-Driven App provides:
- Navigation with organized areas and groups
- Multiple views for different scenarios
- Forms optimized for data entry
- Mobile-responsive design

### Automation


Custom Page provides:
- Barcode scanning interface
- Quick item lookup
- Location updates
- Mobile-optimized UI


### Security Model

Three security roles for separation of duties:
- **Admin**: Full access (create, read, update, delete all)
- **User**: Manage own records (create, read own, update own)
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

## Governance & Compliance

**⭐ IMPORTANT**: Review `governance.md` before deploying to production.

Key governance topics covered:
- Licensing requirements and cost estimation
- Security and access control
- Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
- Data governance and compliance
- Integration authentication
- Monitoring and support
- Risk assessment
- Deployment checklist

## Customization

This solution is designed to be customizable:

### Adding Fields
1. Go to Solutions > Tables > Select table
2. Add new columns as needed
3. Update forms to include new fields

### Modifying Views
1. Solutions > Tables > Select table > Views
2. Edit or create new views
3. Add/remove columns, change filters

### Adding Business Logic
1. Use Business Rules for simple logic (no-code)
2. Use Power Automate for complex workflows
3. Use JavaScript for client-side logic (advanced)

## Environment Portability

This solution is designed to work across environments:

- **Environment Variables**: Use for environment-specific values
- **Connection References**: All connectors use references
- **No Hard-coded URLs**: All references are relative

To move between environments:
1. Export as **Managed** solution
2. Import to target environment
3. Update connection references
4. Update environment variables

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Security role assignment not working
**Solution**: Ensure user has required licenses and correct Business Unit

**Issue**: Flows not triggering
**Solution**: Check connection references are valid and flow is turned on

**Issue**: Mobile scanning not working
**Solution**: Verify Power Apps Mobile app is installed and permissions granted

### Getting Help

- Check `governance.md` for detailed configuration
- Review table definitions in `tables/` folder
- Check flow definitions in `flows/` folder
- Contact Power Platform admin
