# Governance Documentation: AssetTracking

**Generated**: 2025-10-27 14:45:15
**Solution Type**: tracking

## Overview
This document provides IT governance information for deploying and managing this Power Platform solution.

## Security & Access Control

### Security Roles
- **Admin Role**: Full CRUD access to all solution components (Organization scope)
- **User Role**: Create and manage own records (User scope)
- **Viewer Role**: Read-only access (Business Unit scope)

### Data Security
- Table-level security enforced via security roles
- Field-level security available for sensitive data
- Audit logging enabled on all tables

## Licensing Requirements

### Base Requirements
- **Power Apps**: Per-user or per-app license required
- **Dataverse**: Included with Power Apps license
- **Storage**: Estimated 1GB per 1000 records

### Optional Components
- **Power Automate**: Required for approval workflows (per-user or per-flow)
- **Power BI**: Optional for embedded analytics (Pro or Premium per-user)
- **Power Apps Mobile**: Included, no additional license

### Cost Estimation
- Per-user license: $20/user/month (includes Power Apps + Power Automate)
- Per-app license: $5/user/app/month (if only using this app)

## Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)

### Environment Strategy
1. **Development**: Unmanaged solution for building and testing
2. **Test/QA**: Managed solution imported from Development
3. **Production**: Managed solution promoted from Test

### Deployment Process
1. Export solution from Development as **Managed**
2. Import to Test environment
3. Perform user acceptance testing
4. Export from Test, import to Production
5. Use Environment Variables for environment-specific settings

### Source Control
- Export unmanaged solution regularly
- Store in Git repository
- Track changes via pull requests
- Automated deployment via Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions

## Data Governance

### Data Classification
- **Personal Data**: User information (requestor, approver)
- **Business Data**: tracking information
- **Audit Data**: Change history, approval trail

### Compliance Considerations
- **GDPR**: Right to be forgotten (manual data deletion required)
- **Data Residency**: Solution deployed in tenant's default region
- **Retention**: Configure retention policies per table

### DLP Policies
- Ensure connectors are in approved group
- Block unauthorized data connectors
- Monitor connector usage

## Integration Points

### Authentication
**Production (Recommended)**:
- Use Service Principal / Application User
- Register app in Azure AD
- Grant necessary API permissions
- Use in connection references

**Development/Testing**:
- Per-user authentication acceptable
- Switch to service principal before production

### External Connections


### Connection References
All connections use Connection References for environment portability:
- Dataverse connection
- Office 365 (if email notifications)
- (Additional connectors based on solution)

## Monitoring & Support

### Audit Logging
- Enabled on all custom tables
- Tracks create, update, delete operations
- Retention: 90 days (configurable)

### Error Handling
- Power Automate flows include error handling
- Failed flows send alerts to admin
- Errors logged to separate table for review

### Performance Monitoring
- Monitor via Power Platform admin center
- Track API call volume
- Monitor storage consumption

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Data Loss**: Mitigated by backup/restore capabilities
- **Performance**: Dataverse limits apply (see below)
- **Integration Failures**: Retry logic implemented in flows

### Dataverse Limits
- API requests: 100,000/user/day (Power Apps per-user)
- API requests: 10,000/user/day (Power Apps per-app)
- Storage: Monitor consumption via admin center

### Business Risks
- **User Adoption**: Training required for users
- **Change Management**: Phased rollout recommended
- **Support**: Designate solution owner/admin

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Security roles configured and assigned
- [ ] Connection references updated for production
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] DLP policies reviewed
- [ ] User training completed
- [ ] Backup strategy documented
- [ ] Support contacts designated
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured
- [ ] Solution tested in Test environment
- [ ] Approval from IT governance obtained

## Recommended Patterns (from Knowledge Base)

### Asset Tracking with Location
- **Use Case**: Track physical items with location and status
- **Components**: Custom Tables, Virtual Tables (if external data), Custom Pages for mobile, PCF controls
- **Governance**: Mobile device access, barcode scanner permissions


## Support Contacts

- **Solution Owner**: (Assign after deployment)
- **Technical Contact**: Power Platform Admin
- **Business Contact**: (Department head)
